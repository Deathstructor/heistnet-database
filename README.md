# Heist.net database
This is the Heist.net database where the default data for the database is generated.
The data in the database is randomly generated, so this is to generate new data in the database.

### Generate data
To generate data, run this command in the console:
```bash
bun run dev
```
OR
```bash
npm run dev
```
Make sure that Bun or Node is installed before running the command.
After running the command you can simply do CTRL + C to stop the command as you do not need to remain connected to the database for the data to be updated.
